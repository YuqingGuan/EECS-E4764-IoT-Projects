# EECS E4764 Fall 2018 IoT Projects

All these projects are about making a smartwatch on ESP 8266.

> Throughout the course of the semester students will be working on labs, in which the final goal is to build a functional smartwatch. The goal of these labs is to provide students with experience in a broad range of topics within the Internet of Things (IoT). Students will start by building an embedded system (the watch) that directly interfaces with the physical world, before incorporating and communicating with the cloud to perform data analysis and visualization. The diagram below provides a general flow of the final system. By the end of the lab sessions, students will have a basic understanding of all the different components that go into common IoT systems.
